This study drew its data from the Dermanet dataset on kaggle.com. To evaluate the proposed CNN framework, a comparison experiment will be conducted with 61% of the original dataset (i.e. 938 pictures) as the train set and 39% (i.e. 368 images) as the test set. The findings will then be compared with another model without classic data augmentation. If there are enough data samples, this framework should be able to make accurate predictions. As a result, the suggested CNN architecture can serve as the study's starting point. It's possible that the CNN framework had no effect on model performance.

Figure 1: The proposed framework architecture<br/>
There are between 100 and 270 pictures for each category that may be used for training purposes. A total of 368 pictures were randomly picked to serve as the testing dataset (i.e. 39% of all accessible photographs). Table 1 shows list of the dataset classes, including 3 different kind of skin disease such as Nevus, Melanoma and Seborrheic Keratosis.
